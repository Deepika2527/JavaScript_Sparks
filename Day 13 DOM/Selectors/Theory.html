 DOM- Document Object Model.
 By using DOM -We can modify, acess, create, delete the data from the document. We can make the content dynamic.
 Dom- tree structure
 It is a programming interface for web documents.

The DOM represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

In simple words:

Think of DOM as a bridge between HTML and JavaScript. It lets JavaScript access and manipulate the HTML elements on the page.


Key Points to Highlight:

Every HTML document is turned into a DOM tree by the browser.

The DOM tree consists of nodes.
A node is any single point in the DOM tree. Every element, text, and attribute in an HTML document is considered a node.

There are different types of nodes:

Element nodes – <div>, <p>, <h1> etc.

Text nodes – the text inside an element.

Attribute nodes – attributes like id, class, src.

Using JavaScript, we can read, modify, delete, or add nodes dynamically.
