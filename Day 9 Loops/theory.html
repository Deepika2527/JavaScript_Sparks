<!-- 
 Loops- A loops is a block of code, which runs multiple times untilland unless the codtion is s
 satisifed.
 Why do we use loops:
 Loops can help to avoid writing repetitive code.

 Types:
    For: 

    syntax:
         for(initalisation, condtion, inrem/decremt)
    while:

       syntax:
       intialisation
       while(condition){
       //block o code;
       increment/decrement;
       
       }


    do-while:

    do{
    //block of code;
    incr/dec
    
    
    }while(codition)



       
    for-in 
    for-of


    //entry level and the exit level 
    entry-  chekcks first and may/maynt run- for and while
    
    first the condtion will be checed and it will b executed
    cant exected atleast once if the conction is not satisfied
     
    exit level-  runs first and chcks later - do while-

    can execute atleast once






3 main parts
